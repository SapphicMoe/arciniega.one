## Who am I?

Hi there! I'm <Chloe />. I used to go by a lot of names before, but I currently use **solely** and **solelychloe** as my
aliases on the Internet.

I'm a software engineer who has a fascination for anything related to System Administration. And as a hobbyist sysadmin,
I run media & game servers and utilize Virtual Machines for my specialized needs. I also tinker around with vintage
computer hardware!

I'm currently contributing to the following third party Destiny 2 applications as a translator:

- [Braytech][braytech]
- [Destiny Item Manager][dim]
- [Destiny Recipes][drecipes]
- [Little Light][littlelight]

[drecipes]: https://destinyrecipes.com 'Destiny Recipes'

I'm also a member of [Novecore][novecore] and [Dijit][dijit].

As someone who has impaired vision, I try and strive for accessibility where possible! Subtitles and alternate text for
my content is where I want to start first of all.

I like to play video games in my spare time! My favourite games at the moment are **CrossCode**, **OneShot**, **Risk of
Rain 2**, and **Tetris Effect**.
