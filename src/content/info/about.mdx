### Who?

Hi there! We're the **Sapphic Angels** system. We used to go by a lot of names before. You might recognize the usernames **solely** or **solelychloe** before we were plural.

I'm a computer science student at [AlmaU][almau], specializing in Software Engineering. I have a fascination for anything related to System Administration. And as a hobbyist sysadmin,
I run media & game servers and utilize Virtual Machines for our specialized needs. We also tinker around with vintage
computer hardware!

We're currently members of [Dijit][dijit], an unannounced and upcoming Australian-based company.

We also translated these projects in the past:

- [Braytech][braytech]
- [Destiny Item Manager][dim]
- [Destiny Recipes][drecipes]
- [Little Light][littlelight]
- [Novecore][novecore]

As someone who has impaired vision, I try and strive for accessibility where possible! Subtitles and alternate text for
my content is where I want to start first of all.

I like to play video games in our spare time! Our favourite games at the moment are **CrossCode**, **OneShot**, **Risk of
Rain 2**, and **Tetris Effect**.
