I have a compute instance that is running [Owncloud][owncloud], which I use to backup my files and whatnot. The problem
is, my instance has very little storage to actually host anything.

Then I had an idea... what if I could hook up [Cloudflare's R2][r2] service to Owncloud?

## Preamble

_**NOTE**: This guide assumes you're running an instance of Owncloud on a Docker container using **docker-compose**._

If you don't have an instance of Owncloud running on Docker, follow these steps:

- You'll need to install Docker first. The official Docker Docs page provides [a guide][docker-install] on how to
  install Docker on just about every system.

- Then, head over to Owncloud's [documentation page][owncloud-install] and install Owncloud on a Docker container.

## Creating an R2 bucket

Go to your [Cloudflare dashboard][cloudflare-dash] and navigate to the R2 page.  
![R2 page](https://elixi.re/i/k3psp.png 'R2 page on your Cloudflare dashboard.')

You'll want to create a bucket. Make sure you give this bucket a unique name, because you won't be able to change it
afterwards!

For the purposes of this guide, I'll stick with the bucket name `owncloud-instance`.

![Bucket name](https://elixi.re/i/eq5h5.png 'Bucket name')

Once you're done with that, head back to the R2 page, and click on the **Manage R2 API Tokens** link.

At the time of writing this guide, the link should be in the upper right corner.

Then, click on the **Create API token** button.

## Bucket creation options

Let's go through each of the options on the page:

- **Token name**: This is not that important, but if you want to be able to easily identify the R2 token on this page in
  the future, you can set a unique name here.  
  ![Token name option](https://elixi.re/i/x02n8.png 'Token name option')

- **Permissions**: Make sure you set this to **Edit**! Otherwise you may run into permission issues when uploading
  files.  
  ![Permissions option](https://elixi.re/i/c205k.png 'Permissions option')

- **TTL**: If you just want to create this token and forget about it, set this to **Infinity**. Otherwise, this option
  is up to you.  
  ![TTL option](https://elixi.re/i/pkcx0.png 'TTL option')

When you're done, click on the **Create API Token** button.

You'll be able to see your **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** values here. Keep them somewhere safe, as you
will not be able to see them again!

## Installing the S3 extension for Owncloud

Once you're done creating an R2 bucket, head over to your Owncloud admin dashboard.

Click on the menu bar located in the upper left corner, and select the **Market** tab.
![Market tab](https://elixi.re/i/7zakj.png 'Market tab')

Scroll down until you find the **S3 Primary Object Storage** extension, and install it.

_**Note**: You'll want this extension, and not the extension called **External Storage: S3**!_

## Setting up R2 for your Owncloud instance

**<Warning /> Before proceeding any further, make sure you back up all your data. Proceeding with the steps below will
wipe any data you had on your Owncloud instance.**

You're done with all that? Great. It's time to configure R2 to work on your Owncloud instance.

Run the following command: `docker exec -t -i owncloud_server /bin/bash`.  
_You are now inside the filesystem of the Owncloud Docker instance._

Head over to the **config** folder by running `cd config`.

The **config** folder should have the following files:

```bash
> ls

config.php  objectstore.config.php  overwrite.config.php
```

We're looking to edit the **config.php** file. Now run your favourite text editor inside the file. (be it nano, vim,
etc)

Add the following to the **config.php** file:

```php
'objectstore' => [
  'class' => '\\OC\\Files\\ObjectStore\\S3',
  'arguments' => [
    'bucket' => 'BUCKET',
    'autocreate' => true,
    'key'    => 'KEY',
    'secret' => 'SECRET',
    'hostname' => 'ACCOUNT_ID.r2.cloudflarestorage.com',
    'port' => 443,
    'use_ssl' => true,
    'region' => 'auto',
  ],
]
```

## S3 configuration options

Replace the following:

- **bucket**: This is your unique R2 bucket name that you created earlier. (I used `owncloud-instance` for this guide)
- **key**: This is the Access Key ID that you obtained when creating the R2 bucket.
- **secret**: This is the Secret Access Key that you obtained when creating the R2 bucket.
- **hostname**: You can find the bucket hostname on the bucket page itself. Make sure to only include the URL name! (the
  `/owncloud-instance` bit can be removed) ![R2 bucket hostname](https://elixi.re/i/y8e7l.png 'R2 bucket hostname')

Then, run `docker restart owncloud_server` to apply the changes.

And that's it! Log back in to your Owncloud admin dashboard, and your instance should utilize your Cloudflare R2 bucket
as its primary storage.

---

Overall, it's pretty painless for your Owncloud instance to utilize Cloudflare's R2 service.

I will warn you though, Cloudflare's base plan for R2 only includes 10 GB of storage per month.

But it all depends if you're fine with that. :)
