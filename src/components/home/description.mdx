    *If you're still here.. thank you. That means a lot!*

    As someone who has impaired vision, I also try and strive for accessibility where possible! Subtitles & alt text for my content is where I want to start.

    I like to experiment with Rust, TypeScript, Astro, C#, and Docker.

    I also tinker around with vintage computer hardware! Also as an aspiring sysadmin, I transform hardware into NAS, run media & game servers, and utilize Virtual Machines for my specialized needs.

    In my spare time, I like to play video games, listen to my music playlist, learning other languages (Czech, German, etc), and a lot more.
