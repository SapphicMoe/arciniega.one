_If you're still here, thank you! You must be very interested in me._

As someone who has impaired vision, I try and strive for accessibility where possible! Subtitles and alternate text for
my content is where I want to start first of all.

I like to experiment with Rust, TypeScript, Astro, C#, Tailwind and Podman. I also tinker around with vintage computer
hardware! As a hobbyist sysadmin, I run media & game servers and utilize Virtual Machines for my specialized needs.

I like to play video games in my spare time! My favourite games at the moment are **Destiny 2**, **OneShot**, **Risk of
Rain 2**, and **Tetris Effect**.

My current favourite artists are **Paramore**, **Green Day**, **Bring Me The Horizon**, **Set It Off**, **Fall Out
Boy**, **Pierce the Veil**, and **Ace of Hearts**.
