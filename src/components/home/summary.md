*If you're still here, thank you! That means a lot.*

As someone who has impaired vision, I try and strive for accessibility where possible! Subtitles and alternate text for my content is where I want to start first of all.

I like to experiment with Rust, TypeScript, Astro, C#, Tailwind, Docker, and a lot of other, interesting things.  

I also tinker around with vintage computer hardware! As a self-proclaimed sysadmin, I transform hardware into 
<abbr title="Network-attached storage">NAS</abbr>, run media & game servers, and utilize Virtual Machines for my specialized needs.  

In my spare time, I like to play video games, listen to my music playlist, learning other languages (Czech, German, etc), and a lot more.
