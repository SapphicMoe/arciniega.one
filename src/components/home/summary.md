*If you're still here.. thank you. That means a lot!*

As someone who has impaired vision, I also try and strive for accessibility where possible! Subtitles & alt text for my content is where I want to start.  

I like to experiment with Rust, TypeScript, Astro, C#, Tailwind, and Docker.  

I also tinker around with vintage computer hardware! Also as an aspiring sysadmin, I transform hardware into NAS, run media & game servers, and utilize Virtual Machines for my specialized needs.  

In my spare time, I like to play video games, listen to my music playlist, learning other languages (Czech, German, etc), and a lot more.
